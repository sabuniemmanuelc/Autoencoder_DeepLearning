# Autoencoder_DeepLearning
The program is a Python script that performs a comprehensive analysis of a portfolio of stocks using financial data from Yahoo Finance. It incorporates the following key functionalities:

1. Data Retrieval: Retrieves historical stock price data for selected tickers from Yahoo Finance.

2. Dimension Reduction: Applies a sparse autoencoder neural network to reduce the dimensionality of the stock return data.

3. Portfolio Analysis:
   - Calculates and visualizes historical portfolio values and individual stock returns.
   - Creates a heatmap of correlations between stock returns.
   - Computes Value-at-Risk (VaR) to measure portfolio risk.
   - Plots the risk-return trade-off for both individual stocks and the portfolio.

4. Portfolio Optimization: Utilizes Efficient Frontier optimization to find the optimal portfolio allocation based on risk and return, considering multiple asset options.

5. Visualization: Displays portfolio composition, the Efficient Frontier, and the Capital Market Line (CML) to aid in investment decision-making.

The program provides insights into portfolio performance, risk, and optimal asset allocation for investment strategies.
